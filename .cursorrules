# BLE Center - Kotlin Multiplatform Project Rules

## Project Overview
This is a **Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM)** application for managing Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices. The project targets both Android and iOS platforms with shared business logic and UI using Compose Multiplatform.

## Project Structure

### Root Structure
- `/composeApp` - Main application module containing shared and platform-specific code
- `/iosApp` - iOS native application entry point (Swift/SwiftUI)
- `/gradle` - Gradle configuration files including version catalogs

### Source Code Organization (`composeApp/src/`)
- **`commonMain/`** - Shared code for all platforms
  - UI components (Compose Multiplatform)
  - Business logic
  - Data models
  - `expect` declarations for platform-specific APIs
- **`androidMain/`** - Android-specific implementations
  - `actual` implementations of `expect` classes
  - Android-specific BLE APIs (BluetoothAdapter, ScanCallback)
  - MainActivity entry point
- **`iosMain/`** - iOS-specific implementations
  - `actual` implementations of `expect` classes
  - CoreBluetooth integration (to be implemented)
  - MainViewController entry point

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Kotlin**: 2.3.0
- **Kotlin Multiplatform**: For cross-platform code sharing
- **Compose Multiplatform**: 1.10.0 - Shared UI framework
- **Material3**: UI design system

### Android
- **Min SDK**: 24
- **Target SDK**: 36
- **Compile SDK**: 36
- **JVM Target**: 11
- **Android Gradle Plugin**: 8.11.2

### iOS
- **Targets**: iosArm64, iosSimulatorArm64
- **Framework**: Static framework named "ComposeApp"

### Key Dependencies
- `androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-viewmodel-compose` - ViewModel support
- `androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-runtime-compose` - Lifecycle-aware composables
- `org.jetbrains.compose.*` - Compose Multiplatform components

## Architecture Patterns

### Expect/Actual Pattern
The project uses Kotlin's `expect/actual` mechanism for platform-specific implementations:

```kotlin
// commonMain - expect declaration
expect class BleManager {
    fun startScan()
    fun stopScan()
}

// androidMain - actual implementation
actual class BleManager(private val context: Context?) {
    // Android-specific implementation using BluetoothAdapter
}

// iosMain - actual implementation
actual class BleManager {
    // iOS-specific implementation using CoreBluetooth
}
```

### UI Architecture
- **Compose Multiplatform** for shared UI
- **Material3** design system
- **State management**: Using `remember` and `mutableStateOf` for local state
- **Theme**: Custom theme in `ui.theme` package

## Code Conventions

### Package Structure
- Base package: `com.blecenter.blecenter`
- UI theme: `com.blecenter.blecenter.ui.theme`

### Naming Conventions
- Use Kotlin naming conventions (camelCase for functions/variables, PascalCase for classes)
- Platform-specific files: `*.android.kt` for Android, `*.ios.kt` for iOS
- Platform implementations: Use `actual` keyword

### File Organization
- Keep platform-specific code in respective `*Main` folders
- Shared business logic in `commonMain`
- UI components in `commonMain` unless platform-specific styling is needed

## BLE Implementation Details

### Android BLE
- Uses `BluetoothAdapter` and `BluetoothLeScanner`
- Requires permissions: BLUETOOTH, BLUETOOTH_ADMIN, BLUETOOTH_SCAN, BLUETOOTH_CONNECT, ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION
- Permissions declared in `AndroidManifest.xml`
- Uses `ScanCallback` for scan results

### iOS BLE
- Should use CoreBluetooth framework (currently placeholder)
- Requires Info.plist entries for Bluetooth usage descriptions

### Current State
- Android BLE scanning is partially implemented
- iOS BLE scanning is a placeholder (needs CoreBluetooth implementation)
- Device connection functionality is not yet implemented

## Development Guidelines

### Adding New Features
1. **Shared Logic**: Add to `commonMain` if it can be shared
2. **Platform-Specific**: Use `expect/actual` pattern
3. **UI Components**: Use Compose Multiplatform in `commonMain`
4. **Platform UI**: Only if platform-specific UI is absolutely necessary

### Testing
- Common tests go in `commonTest`
- Platform-specific tests in respective test source sets

### Building
- **Android**: `./gradlew :composeApp:assembleDebug`
- **iOS**: Open `/iosApp` in Xcode and run from there

## Important Notes

1. **Package Name**: `com.blecenter.blecenter`
2. **App ID (Android)**: `com.blecenter.blecenter`
3. **Framework Name (iOS)**: `ComposeApp`
4. **Version**: 1.0 (versionCode: 1, versionName: "1.0")

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New Platform-Specific API
1. Declare `expect` in `commonMain`
2. Implement `actual` in both `androidMain` and `iosMain`
3. Ensure both implementations have the same public API

### Adding Dependencies
- Use version catalog in `gradle/libs.versions.toml`
- Add to appropriate source set dependencies in `composeApp/build.gradle.kts`

### UI Development
- Use Material3 components from Compose Multiplatform
- Follow Material Design guidelines
- Test on both platforms when possible

## Notes for AI Assistants

- This is a BLE device management application
- Focus on cross-platform code sharing where possible
- When implementing platform-specific features, ensure both platforms are updated
- The iOS BLE implementation is incomplete and needs CoreBluetooth integration
- Always consider both Android and iOS when making changes to shared code
- Use Compose Multiplatform best practices for UI development
